# RabbitMqPlayground #

A module shows how more advanced topologies could be built, using DLX and message-ttl. 
Module shows example of topology with error fallback and retry mechanism. Additionally for entity.confirm and entity.cancel
topics consumption of messages are delayed.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Magento 2.4.7+ (tested against 2.4.8)
* PHP 8.1/8.2/8.3
* RabbitMQ 3.8+ (tested against 4.1)
* No patches required. [bartoszkubicki/magento2-mq-patches](https://github.com/bartoszkubicki/magento2-mq-patches) previously listed here is now archived — the Magento Message Queue bugs it addressed were fixed upstream in Magento core (see that repo's README for details on which core version fixed each one).

### Installing

#### Download the module

##### Using composer (suggested)

Simply run

```
composer require bkubicki/rabbitmq-playground
```

This module depends on [bkubicki/message-queue](https://github.com/bartoszkubicki/message-queue), which composer will resolve automatically.

##### Downloading ZIP

Download a ZIP version of the module and unpack it into your project into
```
app/code/BKubicki/RabbitMqPlayground
```
If you use ZIP file you will need to install all dependencies of the module
manually


#### Install the module

Run this command
```
bin/magento module:enable BKubicki_RabbitMqPlayground
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## Usage

Just install module and investigate topology created. Play around by 
publishing messages (take a look at console commands) and observe how messages are handled. Every consumer handler
has a sleep function inside to make sure that message processing is visible in rabbitmq admin panel messages chart.
Change consumers (`Failure` / `Success` in `queue_consumer.xml` to test different situations.
Topology created by the module should look like on the [graph](docs/topology.png)
